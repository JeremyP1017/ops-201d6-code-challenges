The first command enables the File and Printer Sharing firewall rule so that the endpoint can share files and printers with other devices on the network
.# Enable File and Printer Sharing
1.Set-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup "File and Printer Sharing" -Enabled True

The second command creates a new firewall rule to allow ICMP traffic, which is necessary for tools like ping and traceroute to function.
# Allow ICMP traffic
2.New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "ICMPv4" -Protocol ICMPv4

The third command enables PowerShell Remoting, which allows remote access to the endpoint's PowerShell command line.
# Enable Remote management
3.Enable-PSRemoting -Force

The fourth command removes bloatware applications that are commonly installed on Windows 10 but may not be necessary for all users. In this example,
we've excluded the Microsoft Store app, Calculator, Sticky Notes, and Camera app from the list of apps to be removed.
# Remove bloatware
4.Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers | Where-Object {$_.Name -notlike "*store*" -and $_.Name -notlike "*calc*" -and $_.Name -notlike "*sticky*" -and $_.Name -notlike 
"*camera*"} | Remove-AppxPackage

The fifth command enables the Hyper-V role, which allows the endpoint to run virtual machines.
# Enable Hyper-V
5.Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All


The sixth command disables the SMBv1 protocol, which is an insecure protocol that can be used for malware attacks.
# Disable SMBv1
6.Set-SmbServerConfiguration -EnableSMB1Protocol $false
